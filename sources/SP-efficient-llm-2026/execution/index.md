## Discovery canonical refresh (Sol PASS adopted; lifecycle unchanged)

- Sol Discovery Completeness Review: `PASS` (Sol / GPT-5.6) — `execution/reviews/sol-discovery-completeness-review-pass.md`
- Canonical Discovery JSONL: `discovery/discovery-v2.jsonl` (161 records EFF-D001–EFF-D161: r1 BASE 100 + r2 GAP_FILL 42 + r3 GAP_FILL 19; SHA `a94d8cbb64e1049480ea13690e7584e79ed6cdf7b830ba150f594e046880f53d`)
- Canonical acceptance: `discovery/discovery-accepted-v2.json` (record_count 161, Core-built; SHA `3aa62c4218df55155e99a8eb5de3158a4b5e0ac950a9ddbffcc6099f2f69e79c`)
- Stage checkpoint: `orchestration/v2/checkpoints/ISSUE_INITIALIZED.json` (refreshed via `CURRENT_CORE_DISCOVERY_STAGE_BUILDER_REPLAY`, W34 precedent `8a937da`; SHA `28cdd7755b8cb003c9917e8899f95e3a31468162c583474ad4021b4fa51611ca`)

- Refresh tooling/validation: `execution/discovery-refresh-after-sol-pass/refresh_discovery_checkpoint.py`, `validation/`
- r2/r3 standalone artifacts unchanged and still valid; EFF-O13/14/15 retained as Discovery provenance (no profile/Core edits)
- Screening preflight: real resolver → `DIRECT`, 161 effective records; Screening NOT executed
- Session: `sessions/ts001-reissue-discovery-refresh-20260922.md`

## Grok/X

- Profile applicability policy: `CHATGPT_DECIDES`
- Initial decision: `NOT_REQUIRED` for first run (primary map first; Sol designs later reception pass)
- Current decision: `REQUIRED` — one bounded reception/deployment pass (`efficient-llm-reception-pass-01`); Human-requested practical dimension became material after Sol technical Discovery PASS (which remains valid)
- Manifest: `external/x/x-source-intake-v2.json` (`REQUIRED / COMPLETE`; r3 SUCCESS, DISCOVERY_RECORDED [EFF-D162])
- Repository task: `external/x/efficient-llm-reception-pass-01/grok-task.md` (20555 bytes, SHA `c1150730c6a0a758c4fd2e85928e593e49484765c4fe68864fe784fdde9220e2`)
- Expected Drive task path: `Grok_X_SourseIntake/Thematic_Special/efficient-llm-2026/efficient-llm-reception-pass-01/grok-task.md`
- Expected Drive result path: `Grok_X_SourseIntake/Thematic_Special/efficient-llm-2026/efficient-llm-reception-pass-01/x-reception-result.md`
- Result: pending (no Grok run, no Drive action by Muse)
- Pre-Grok Sol review: `execution/reviews/sol-pre-grok-reception-task-review-r1.md` (Sol / GPT-5.6, PASS, DRIVE_HANDOFF_AUTHORIZED)
- X reception reviews: r1 `execution/reviews/sol-x-reception-r1-review-20260922.md` (REQUEST_CORRECTION — six records only, no ledger; NOT imported); r2 `execution/reviews/sol-x-reception-r2-review-20260922.md` (REQUEST_CORRECTION — FIRST_HAND recount 17/3/7 vs claimed 19/3/5, no consistency token, bad observed_at; NOT imported); r3 `execution/reviews/sol-x-reception-r3-review-20260922.md` (Sol / GPT-5.6 PASS / IMPORT_AUTHORIZED — 27 records / 27 URLs / 24 accounts / 20 independent; Drive ID `181CYeFFZDtucPikWJr3EzWZGycdF_Mxo`, 30213 bytes, SHA `b3a8a0404e6d4a1abfaa6bde54c4a6f5d7979ec24870bcd629865f8443377d79`)
- r3 import status: `EXACT_RAW_BYTES_UNAVAILABLE` — Muse has no Drive channel; no Raw import, no manifest completion, no X Discovery record, no F1–F4, no refresh performed. Resume criteria in `sessions/ts001-reissue-x-r3-import-blocked-20260922.md` (verify 30213 bytes + SHA before any import).
- Boundary: machine lifecycle stays `DISCOVERY_COLLECTED`; operational interpretation `TECHNICAL_DISCOVERY_CANONICAL / TARGETED_X_SOURCE_INTAKE_REOPENED / AWAITING_GROK`; Screening NOT authorized until X result disposition + canonical Discovery refresh
- Session: `sessions/ts001-reissue-x-reception-prep-20260922.md`

## Deviations

- None. No Screening/Evidence/Selection/Architecture/Draft work performed (out of scope for this run).

## Shared Core defects

- None encountered. No shared-Core files modified (verified: only tracked change is planning
  authority `docs/thematic-special-backlog.md`; all else is edition-local under
  `sources/SP-efficient-llm-2026/`).

## Screening (COMPLETE — Sol PASS recorded; package corrected)

- Canonical Discovery at Screening: 165 records (`7074cef2…`); acceptance 165 via Core tooling.
- New this run: `discovery/discovery-v2-r4.jsonl` (EFF-D162 X ledger + F1–F3 EFF-D163–165, GAP_FILL/pass 3); F4 `INDEPENDENT_WRITEUP_NOT_RESOLVED`; raw `raw/discovery-observations-r4-x-followup.md`.
- X manifest COMPLETE (r3 SUCCESS, DISCOVERY_RECORDED [EFF-D162]).
- Screening acceptance: `screening/v2/accepted/24bac6aa5c849eb2f6ac46f2162c7333137230cfec2610e908815a0e591b045d/screening-accepted.json` (DIRECT basis, 165 records).
- Dispositions: 135 KEEP / 20 MAYBE / 5 INSPECT / 5 DROP (DROPs are accepted PRIMARY_PAPER D140 D158 D159 D160 D161; no primary/capstone authority dropped; X D162 KEEP with boundary).
- Checkpoint: `orchestration/v2/checkpoints/DISCOVERY_COLLECTED.json`; lifecycle `CANDIDATES_NORMALIZED`.
- Sol review package r1: `execution/reviews/screening-review-package-r1.md` (preserved as historical output; factually defective counts).
- Corrected package r2: `execution/reviews/screening-review-package-r2.md` (`CORRECTED / SUPERSEDES_R1_FOR_SOL_REVIEW`; all counts mechanically recomputed from canonical bytes: source-class table, obligation table, O11 32/9/2/0; r1 defect ledger included).
- Sol Screening review: `execution/reviews/sol-screening-review-pass-20260922.md` (Sol / GPT-5.6, `PASS / PROCEED_TO_EVIDENCE`; acceptance unchanged; Selection NOT authorized).
- Run tooling: `execution/x-completion/` (prior-authority, refresh/advance scripts, decisions provenance, validation).

## Evidence (first attempt STAGE-BLOCKED — historical; superseded below)

- Canonical Evidence/Materiality/Completeness production run did NOT complete: `run_evidence_v2_interactive.py` fail-closes with `unsupported source_type for Evidence authority: 'PRIMARY_DOC'` (first failure on EFF-D004). No Evidence/Views/Ledger/Completeness artifact was produced.
- Defect: `execution/defects/shared-core-evidence-source-map-gap-20260922.md` — Core v2 Evidence `SOURCE_CLASS_MAP` lacks 10 Thematic Discovery source types (PRIMARY_DOC 13, PRIMARY_REPO 21, PRIMARY_ANNOUNCEMENT 8, PRIMARY_MODEL_CARD 6, PRIMARY_SPEC 4, SECONDARY_REFERENCE 8, SECONDARY_TECHNICAL 4, RUNTIME_RECIPE 1, PACKAGING_DOCS 1, RUNTIME_PR 1 = 67/160 tasks). Runnable: 93 (PRIMARY_PAPER 92 + x-community-signal 1). Shared Core unchanged; no silent patch; failed run is failed evidence.
- Preserved Luna input: `execution/evidence-interactive-input/` — 160-record `interactive-evidence.json` (SHA `6cac92b1…`; 155 PARTIAL / 5 VERIFIED; 134 MATERIAL / 24 CONTEXT / 2 HOLD) + generator parts + task-target dump + README with resume criteria. Validated: exact 160-ID coverage, exact per-task verification-target match, Completeness O01–O12 (3 SATISFIED / 9 LIMITATION, LIMITED).
- Authority-consumption package r1 (stage-blocked): `execution/reviews/evidence-authority-consumption-package-r1.md` — 95 arXiv abstracts + 9 full pages consumed; 9 wrong-identity bound arXiv locators found with verified true identities (gap-fill triggers G-EV-01–11: D005/D061/D062/D093/D094/D098/D112/D117/D139 + DSA URLs + AIPerf successor); INSPECT outcomes (D032/D093 HOLD; D077/D119/D150 PARTIAL); MAYBE outcomes (watches held); capstone/Jev/X/F1–F4/O13–O15/methodology status; bodies-richer-than-claims list; Selection-must-not-proceed reasons.
- Authority states: CONSUMED (95 abstracts at scope + 9 pages + X ledger); CAPTURED_BUT_UNCONSUMED (54 locator-bound + abstract-only full bodies); RETRIEVAL_FAILED (none); NOT_FOUND (F4, AIPerf product surface, T-Bench v1 ID, DeepSWE primary, Jev independent reproduction + calibration protocol, non-MSR 1-bit deployment).
- Lifecycle remains `CANDIDATES_NORMALIZED`; Selection NOT started. Resume: reviewed Core map repair → clean re-run of preserved input → `EVIDENCE_REVIEWED` → Sol authority-consumption/materiality review.
- Session: `sessions/ts001-reissue-evidence-20260922.md`.

## Evidence (ACCEPTED via frozen-Core compatibility; Sol review due)

- Compatibility authority: `execution/compat/evidence-source-class-projection/`
  (README, adapter scripts, persisted `compat-package/` SHA `60860c88…`,
  `projection-ledger.json` 160 rows, `task-targets.json`,
  `validation-report.md`). Projection: 160 tasks, 67 projected / 93
  per-type (PRIMARY_DOC 13, PRIMARY_REPO 21, PRIMARY_ANNOUNCEMENT 8,
  PRIMARY_MODEL_CARD 6, PRIMARY_SPEC 4, SECONDARY_REFERENCE 8,
  SECONDARY_TECHNICAL 4, RUNTIME_RECIPE 1, PACKAGING_DOCS 1, RUNTIME_PR 1);
  §7 field-identity held; `COMPATIBILITY_REPRODUCIBILITY: PASS`; frozen
  `validate_evidence_package_basis` PASS. CV2-DM-016 stays OPEN_CORE.
- Supplement r1: `external/evidence-supplement/evidence-authority-supplement-r1.json`
  (SHA `62031208…`; 13 sources / 1,275,978 Raw bytes under `raw/`; frozen-built
  + frozen-validated). All 9 wrong-identity arXiv locators independently
  re-verified; Sarathi-Serve 2403.02310 confirmed as same-line 2024 follow-up
  and bound additively; DeeBERT independently resolved (2004.12993).
  Canonical Discovery locators preserved untouched.
- Fresh input r2: `execution/evidence-interactive-input-r2/` (JSON SHA
  `5f8395d0…`; 160 records; 148 PARTIAL / 12 VERIFIED; 137 MATERIAL /
  23 CONTEXT / 0 HOLD; 11 supplement-bound; r1 input preserved). Deeper
  body consumption: ThinkPrune/overthinking/Snell/s1/FrugalGPT/RouteLLM/
  EAGLE/MTP/V4.1/Qwen/Kimi/V3.2/V4/Engram sections + DSA launch page.
- Frozen chain outputs (all frozen-judged): Evidence acceptance `dba89409…`
  (160 Cards: PARTIAL 148 / VERIFIED 12); Views acceptance `2bf475f5…`
  (160); ledger `materiality-ledger-v2.json` (165 rows: MATERIAL 137 /
  CONTEXT 23 / EXCLUDED 5); completeness `profile-completeness-v2.json`
  (LIMITED; 15 obligations: 3 SATISFIED / 12 LIMITATION incl. O13–O15 rows
  with Profile-declared dimensions, required by the frozen named-obligation
  guard; deviation documented in driver).
- Advance: `execution/evidence-stage-advance/validation/` (stage validation
  PASS + reviews) → checkpoint `orchestration/v2/checkpoints/CANDIDATES_NORMALIZED.json`
  (SHA `b69d2a0b…`) → lifecycle `EVIDENCE_REVIEWED` (State SHA `e5f1875f…`;
  next_action `stage:selection`, NOT entered).

## Final disposition

`ARCHITECTURE ESTABLISHED / HUMAN ARCHITECTURE REVIEW PENDING / CORE V2 UNCHANGED`
(machine lifecycle `ARCHITECTURE_ESTABLISHED`) — Selection and proposed
Architecture completed through the frozen Core interactive runner under Sol
Evidence PASS boundaries (`PASS / PROCEED_TO_SELECTION_WITH_SCOPE_BOUNDARIES`,
Sol / GPT-5.6): 160 Matrix candidates assigned (SELECTED 112 = 53 PRIMARY /
59 SUPPORTING, HOLD 12, REJECT 33, INSPECT 3), 9-package PROPOSED Architecture
(target 76 / max 96) with READY_FOR_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW summary, D128
abstract-scope correction propagated, X/D164 bounded, Jev mandatory case,
DROP continuity kept. Human Architecture Review pending; Publication Preview
pending; no Human approval provenance; drafting not started. Sol Architecture
review and the Human-facing dossier remain due before any Gate presentation.

## Sol Evidence Review (PASS)

- Review: `execution/reviews/sol-evidence-review-pass-20260922.md` (Sol / GPT-5.6,
  `PASS / PROCEED_TO_SELECTION_WITH_SCOPE_BOUNDARIES`; materialized by Muse,
  authorship Sol's; active Evidence `72ba3407…` / Views `364d484a…` bound).
- Binding directives applied: D128 abstract-scope correction (no
  four-capstone full-body language; D128 PRIMARY-but-abstract-scope); D162
  SUPPORTING-only; D164 GGUF/local-only with vendor figures quarantined; Jev
  mandatory bounded case; no headline-number selection; DROP continuity;
  explicit MAYBE/INSPECT/watch negative-space rationale.
- CV2-DM-016 / CV2-DM-017 remain `OPEN_CORE / EDITION_WORKAROUND`; shared Core
  unchanged (see Final audit).

## Selection (COMPLETE)

- Input builder (edition-local): `execution/selection-architecture-input/build_selection_architecture_input.py`
  → `execution/selection-architecture-input/interactive-selection-architecture.json`
  (160/160 Matrix IDs; 112 SELECTED / 33 REJECT / 12 HOLD / 3 INSPECT).
- Runner: frozen `scripts/run_selection_architecture_v2_interactive.py` →
  `candidate-matrix-v2.json` (SHA `1dcc2902…`), `candidate-selection-v2.json`
  (SHA `f91af7cf…`), archived input `orchestration/v2/interactive/selection-architecture-input.json`
  + `selection-architecture-audit.json`.
- Advance: `execution/selection-stage-advance/advance_selection.py` (frozen stage
  validation PASS + reviews) → checkpoint `orchestration/v2/checkpoints/EVIDENCE_REVIEWED.json`
  (SHA `f0255d39…`) → lifecycle `SELECTION_COMPLETE` (recorded 2026-09-22T17:30:00Z).
- Safeguards: selected_count 112 within [40, 120]; no trigger fired; explicit
  per-candidate compression rationale recorded regardless.

## Architecture (ESTABLISHED / PROPOSED — Human review pending)

- 9 packages P1 bottleneck → P9 methodology (structure in
  `execution/reviews/architecture-review-prep-r1.md` §15); thesis: layered-systems
  efficiency (not a model ranking); reader title `Efficient Intelligence —
  LLMを速く、軽く、安くする技術史`; page plan target 76 / max 96.
- Runner outputs: `architecture-v2.json` (SHA `e214040b…`, PROPOSED, human_review
  null), `architecture-review-summary-v2.json` (SHA `bc4a40d8…`,
  READY_FOR_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW, zero errors), `architecture-review-attention-v2.json`
  (SHA `970c3231…`).
- Advance: `execution/architecture-stage-advance/advance_architecture.py` (frozen
  stage validation PASS + reviews; PROPOSED/null-human-review guards) →
  checkpoint `orchestration/v2/checkpoints/SELECTION_COMPLETE.json` (SHA
  `6f5f3fa1…`) → lifecycle `ARCHITECTURE_ESTABLISHED` (recorded 2026-09-22T18:00:00Z).
- Operator prep package for Sol (NOT the Human dossier):
  `execution/reviews/architecture-review-prep-r1.md` (22 items + negative-space
  audit appendix; no structurally serious case; HOLD/INSPECT are intentional).
- Alternatives A (encyclopedia) / B (model-by-model) / C (pure bottleneck) evaluated
  and rejected in prep §20; Sol judges.

## Final audit (this run)

- Shared Core diff (scripts/schemas/config/.github/workflows + Core docs):
  zero changes; CV2-DM-016/017 OPEN_CORE preserved; compatibility stays
  edition-local; `__pycache__` residue removed before commit.
